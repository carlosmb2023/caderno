After a scoreless first quarter, Green Bay delivered the game's opening punch in the second quarter with quarterback Aaron Rodgers finding wide receiver Greg Jennings on a 3-yard touchdown pass. The Packers added to their lead in the third quarter with a 1-yard touchdown run from fullback John Kuhn, followed by Rodgers connecting with wide receiver James Jones on a 65-yard touchdown pass and a 35-yard field goal from kicker Mason Crosby. The Lions answered in the fourth quarter with a 16-yard touchdown run by running back Keiland Williams and a two-point conversion pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford to wide receiver Titus Young), yet Green Bay pulled away with Crosby nailing a 32-yard field goal. Detroit closed out the game with Stafford completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Calvin Johnson.

Plan ahead, and build your knowledge base about the topics you\\u2019re studying for work or school. Additionally, get all of your assignments finished before they\\u2019re due. Keep a planner or use the calendar in your phone to help yourself stay on top of things. Maintain good posture by standing up straight and pressing your shoulders back. Smile, keep your arms at your sides, and look at your surroundings. When you talk to people, focus on your talents and achievements, not your flaws. If you want to increase your confidence, do something small every day that makes you feel accomplished. You can also do more things you enjoy and take calculated risks. For example, you might try out for a sports team, enter an art show, or volunteer to take the lead on a project. Punctuality is essential if you want to appear serious and professional. Always be on time or early for things. Set an alarm or calendar entry on your phone to help you remember when you need to be places. Everyone encounters obstacles at one time or another. If you\\u2019re going to be late due to an emergency or unforeseen event, call ahead and let people know. Say exactly what you mean, and ask for what you need. Always be kind and respectful when you provide feedback, but don\\u2019t be vague because you think it will spare someone\\u2019s feelings. Additionally, don\\u2019t say more than you need to say.  Don\\u2019t expect people to guess what you\\u2019re thinking. If it\\u2019s important, just tell them. Let's say you're working on a group project and think one person is holding up your progress. You might say, \\\"Our group project is coming along, but I'm worried you aren't going to be finished with your part on time. Can you get it finished by tomorrow?\\\" Avoid meaningless chatter, as talking too much can make people see you as unprofessional. Additionally, speaking less often will make your words carry more impact. Keep it professional by only sharing your best thoughts and ideas. For example, don\\u2019t add to workplace gossip or chat about topics like TV shows and sports. However, do speak up when you know the answer to a question or when you have a great idea to share. Appearing to be unsure can make you look unprofessional or flaky. At the same time, you\\u2019re not going to have all of the answers. To protect your image, respond positively but buy yourself some time to think about what you\\u2019ll do or say next. You might say, \\u201cThat\\u2019s a really great point. I\\u2019m going to think that over today and get back to you tomorrow with my response,\\u201d or \\u201cI appreciate your feedback. It\\u2019s given me a lot to think about.\\u201d Talking about your personal life too often or at the wrong times can make you look less professional. At the same time, talking about your life may help you bond with others. Choose the right times to share personal details about yourself, such as during lunch, breaks, and post-work or after-school events. During work hours or class, stick to topics related to work or school, as well as current events. Similarly, don\\u2019t gossip about others\\u2019 personal lives. People may perceive you as immature and unprofessional. If your friends or coworkers are gossiping, change the subject. You might say, \\u201cAll I\\u2019m thinking about right now is our project that\\u2019s due next week. Have any of you started?\\u201d Do what you say you\\u2019ll do, when you say you\\u2019ll do it. Write all of your tasks and appointments in a planner or the calendar in your phone to keep track of everything. That way, nothing will be forgotten. If you don\\u2019t follow through, people won\\u2019t respect you because they\\u2019ll perceive you as being immature and unprofessional.\\n\\nWhat is a summary?\",\n          \"I know that the answer to the question \\\"Who serves those who can perform good actions, producing merit?\\\" is in \\\"Theravadin Buddhists believe that personal effort is required to realize rebirth.

This streamlines the evaluation process for Google's latest and most capable family of large language models. With minimal coding effort, you can leverage pre-defined metrics and workflows to assess the performance of Gemini models on various tasks. You can also customize your own model-based metrics based on your specific evaluation criteria.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `EvalTask` class is a core component of the *Gen AI Evaluation Service SDK* framework. It allows you to define and run evaluation jobs against your Gen AI models/applications, providing a structured way to measure their performance on specific tasks. Think of an `EvalTask` as a blueprint for your evaluation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "`EvalTask` class requires an evaluation dataset and a list of metrics. Supported metrics are documented on the Generative AI on Vertex AI [Define your evaluation metrics](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/determine-eval) page. The dataset can be an `pandas.DataFrame`, Python dictionary or a file path URI and can contain default column names such as `prompt`, `reference`, `response`, and `baseline_model_response`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bring-your-own-response (BYOR):** You already have the data that you want to evaluate stored in the dataset. You can customize the response column names for both your model and the baseline model using parameters like `response_column_name` and `baseline_model_response_column_name` or through the `metric_column_mapping`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Perform model inference without a prompt template:** You have a dataset containing the input prompts to the model and want to perform model inference before evaluation. A column named `prompt` is required in the evaluation dataset and is used directly as input to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Perform model inference with a prompt template:** You have a dataset containing the input variables to the prompt template and want to assemble the prompts for model inference. Evaluation dataset must contain column names corresponding to the variable names in the prompt template. For example, if prompt template is \"Instruction: {instruction}, context: {context}\", the dataset must contain `instruction` and `context` columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`EvalTask` supports extensive evaluation scenarios including BYOR, model inference with Gemini models, 3P models endpoints/SDK clients, or custom model generation functions, using computation-based metrics, model-based pointwise and pairwise metrics. The `evaluate()` method triggers the evaluation process, optionally taking a model, prompt template, experiment logging configuartions, and other evaluation run configurations. You can view the SDK reference documentation for [Gen AI Evaluation package](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/reference/python/latest/vertexai.evaluation) for more details."

People may perceive you as immature and unprofessional. If your friends or coworkers are gossiping, change the subject. You might say, \\u201cAll I\\u2019m thinking about right now is our project that\\u2019s due next week. Have any of you started?\\u201d Do what you say you\\u2019ll do, when you say you\\u2019ll do it. Write all of your tasks and appointments in a planner or the calendar in your phone to keep track of everything. That way, nothing will be forgotten. If you don\\u2019t follow through, people won\\u2019t respect you because they\\u2019ll perceive you as being immature and unprofessional.\\n\\nWhat is a summary?\",\n          \"# System_prompt\\n # Question\\nI know that the answer to the question \\\"Who serves those who can perform good actions, producing merit?\\\" is in \\\"Theravadin Buddhists believe that personal effort is required to realize rebirth.

      "Article: This also helps you perform well and appear accomplished, which makes you seem more professional. Plan ahead, and build your knowledge base about the topics you’re studying for work or school. Additionally, get all of your assignments finished before they’re due. Keep a planner or use the calendar in your phone to help yourself stay on top of things. Maintain good posture by standing up straight and pressing your shoulders back. Smile, keep your arms at your sides, and look at your surroundings. When you talk to people, focus on your talents and achievements, not your flaws. If you want to increase your confidence, do something small every day that makes you feel accomplished. You can also do more things you enjoy and take calculated risks. For example, you might try out for a sports team, enter an art show, or volunteer to take the lead on a project. Punctuality is essential if you want to appear serious and professional. Always be on time or early for things. Set an alarm or calendar entry on your phone to help you remember when you need to be places. Everyone encounters obstacles at one time or another. If you’re going to be late due to an emergency or unforeseen event, call ahead and let people know. Say exactly what you mean, and ask for what you need. Always be kind and respectful when you provide feedback, but don’t be vague because you think it will spare someone’s feelings. Additionally, don’t say more than you need to say.  Don’t expect people to guess what you’re thinking. If it’s important, just tell them. Let's say you're working on a group project and think one person is holding up your progress. You might say, \"Our group project is coming along, but I'm worried you aren't going to be finished with your part on time. Can you get it finished by tomorrow?\" Avoid meaningless chatter, as talking too much can make people see you as unprofessional. Additionally, speaking less often will make your words carry more impact. Keep it professional by only sharing your best thoughts and ideas. For example, don’t add to workplace gossip or chat about topics like TV shows and sports. However, do speak up when you know the answer to a question or when you have a great idea to share. Appearing to be unsure can make you look unprofessional or flaky. At the same time, you’re not going to have all of the answers. To protect your image, respond positively but buy yourself some time to think about what you’ll do or say next. You might say, “That’s a really great point. I’m going to think that over today and get back to you tomorrow with my response,” or “I appreciate your feedback. It’s given me a lot to think about.” Talking about your personal life too often or at the wrong times can make you look less professional. At the same time, talking about your life may help you bond with others. Choose the right times to share personal details about yourself, such as during lunch, breaks, and post-work or after-school events. During work hours or class, stick to topics related to work or school, as well as current events. Similarly, don’t gossip about others’ personal lives. People may perceive you as immature and unprofessional. If your friends or coworkers are gossiping, change the subject. You might say, “All I’m thinking about right now is our project that’s due next week. Have any of you started?” Do what you say you’ll do, when you say you’ll do it. Write all of your tasks and appointments in a planner or the calendar in your phone to keep track of everything. That way, nothing will be forgotten.

Burt and Loni, those were the days! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner. I sure loved that advertisement! Plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment! I laughed so hard I almost passed away into the night! If you can find this movie, rent it! And then never watch another movie again, because I tell you right now: there's no point.\n",

      "Write a question about the following article: Coming off their home win over the Buccaneers, the Packers flew to Ford Field for a Week 12 Thanksgiving duel with their NFC North foe, the Detroit Lions. After a scoreless first quarter, Green Bay delivered the game's opening punch in the second quarter with quarterback Aaron Rodgers finding wide receiver Greg Jennings on a 3-yard touchdown pass. The Packers added to their lead in the third quarter with a 1-yard touchdown run from fullback John Kuhn, followed by Rodgers connecting with wide receiver James Jones on a 65-yard touchdown pass and a 35-yard field goal from kicker Mason Crosby. The Lions answered in the fourth quarter with a 16-yard touchdown run by running back Keiland Williams and a two-point conversion pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford to wide receiver Titus Young), yet Green Bay pulled away with Crosby nailing a 32-yard field goal. Detroit closed out the game with Stafford completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Calvin Johnson. With the win, the Packers acquired their first 11-0 start in franchise history, beating the 1962 team which started 10-0 and finished 14-1 including postseason play. Rodgers (22/32 for 307 yards, 2 TDs) was named NFL on FOX's 2011 Galloping Gobbler Award Winner.\n",

You might say, \"Our group project is coming along, but I'm worried you aren't going to be finished with your part on time. Can you get it finished by tomorrow?\" Avoid meaningless chatter, as talking too much can make people see you as unprofessional. Additionally, speaking less often will make your words carry more impact. Keep it professional by only sharing your best thoughts and ideas. For example, don’t add to workplace gossip or chat about topics like TV shows and sports. However, do speak up when you know the answer to a question or when you have a great idea to share. Appearing to be unsure can make you look unprofessional or flaky. At the same time, you’re not going to have all of the answers. To protect your image, respond positively but buy yourself some time to think about what you’ll do or say next. You might say, “That’s a really great point. I’m going to think that over today and get back to you tomorrow with my response,” or “I appreciate your feedback. It’s given me a lot to think about.” Talking about your personal life too often or at the wrong times can make you look less professional. At the same time, talking about your life may help you bond with others. Choose the right times to share personal details about yourself, such as during lunch, breaks, and post-work or after-school events. During work hours or class, stick to topics related to work or school, as well as current events. Similarly, don’t gossip about others’ personal lives. People may perceive you as immature and unprofessional. If your friends or coworkers are gossiping, change the subject. You might say, “All I’m thinking about right now is our project that’s due next week. Have any of you started?” Do what you say you’ll do, when you say you’ll do it. Write all of your tasks and appointments in a planner or the calendar in your phone to keep track of everything. That way, nothing will be forgotten. If you don’t follow through, people won’t respect you because they’ll perceive you as being immature and unprofessional.\n",

Plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment!

You might say, “All I’m thinking about right now is our project that’s due next week. Have any of you started?” Do what you say you’ll do, when you say you’ll do it. Write all of your tasks and appointments in a planner or the calendar in your phone to keep track of everything. That way, nothing will be forgotten. If you don’t follow through, people won’t respect you because they’ll perceive you as being immature and unprofessional.\n",

      "Article: This also helps you perform well and appear accomplished, which makes you seem more professional. Plan ahead, and build your knowledge base about the topics you’re studying for work or school. Additionally, get all of your assignments finished before they’re due. Keep a planner or use the calendar in your phone to help yourself stay on top of things. Maintain good posture by standing up straight and pressing your shoulders back. Smile, keep your arms at your sides, and look at your surroundings. When you talk to people, focus on your talents and achievements, not your flaws. If you want to increase your confidence, do something small every day that makes you feel accomplished. You can also do more things you enjoy and take calculated risks. For example, you might try out for a sports team, enter an art show, or volunteer to take the lead on a project. Punctuality is essential if you want to appear serious and professional. Always be on time or early for things. Set an alarm or calendar entry on your phone to help you remember when you need to be places. Everyone encounters obstacles at one time or another. If you’re going to be late due to an emergency or unforeseen event, call ahead and let people know. Say exactly what you mean, and ask for what you need. Always be kind and respectful when you provide feedback, but don’t be vague because you think it will spare someone’s feelings. Additionally, don’t say more than you need to say.  Don’t expect people to guess what you’re thinking. If it’s important, just tell them. Let's say you're working on a group project and think one person is holding up your progress. You might say, \"Our group project is coming along, but I'm worried you aren't going to be finished with your part on time. Can you get it finished by tomorrow?\" Avoid meaningless chatter, as talking too much can make people see you as unprofessional. Additionally, speaking less often will make your words carry more impact. Keep it professional by only sharing your best thoughts and ideas. For example, don’t add to workplace gossip or chat about topics like TV shows and sports. However, do speak up when you know the answer to a question or when you have a great idea to share. Appearing to be unsure can make you look unprofessional or flaky. At the same time, you’re not going to have all of the answers. To protect your image, respond positively but buy yourself some time to think about what you’ll do or say next. You might say, “That’s a really great point. I’m going to think that over today and get back to you tomorrow with my response,” or “I appreciate your feedback. It’s given me a lot to think about.” Talking about your personal life too often or at the wrong times can make you look less professional. At the same time, talking about your life may help you bond with others. Choose the right times to share personal details about yourself, such as during lunch, breaks, and post-work or after-school events. During work hours or class, stick to topics related to work or school, as well as current events. Similarly, don’t gossip about others’ personal lives. People may perceive you as immature and unprofessional. If your friends or coworkers are gossiping, change the subject. You might say, “All I’m thinking about right now is our project that’s due next week. Have any of you started?” Do what you say you’ll do, when you say you’ll do it. Write all of your tasks and appointments in a planner or the calendar in your phone to keep track of everything. That way, nothing will be forgotten. If you don’t follow through, people won’t respect you because they’ll perceive you as being immature and unprofessional.\n",

      "I love old Burt Reynolds movies. They're funnier and better than every other movie combined. They might as well have stopped making movies after \"Cannonball Run 2\", but I guess how could they have known that there weren't going to be any more good ones? Man this movie's good. Burt Reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot, and the luxuriant Loni Anderson is on hand, looking extremely hot in an eightiesly way. Burt and Loni, those were the days! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner. I sure loved that advertisement! Plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment! I laughed so hard I almost passed away into the night! If you can find this movie, rent it! And then never watch another movie again, because I tell you right now: there's no point.\n",

      "Write a question about the following article: Coming off their home win over the Buccaneers, the Packers flew to Ford Field for a Week 12 Thanksgiving duel with their NFC North foe, the Detroit Lions. After a scoreless first quarter, Green Bay delivered the game's opening punch in the second quarter with quarterback Aaron Rodgers finding wide receiver Greg Jennings on a 3-yard touchdown pass. The Packers added to their lead in the third quarter with a 1-yard touchdown run from fullback John Kuhn, followed by Rodgers connecting with wide receiver James Jones on a 65-yard touchdown pass and a 35-yard field goal from kicker Mason Crosby. The Lions answered in the fourth quarter with a 16-yard touchdown run by running back Keiland Williams and a two-point conversion pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford to wide receiver Titus Young), yet Green Bay pulled away with Crosby nailing a 32-yard field goal. Detroit closed out the game with Stafford completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Calvin Johnson. With the win, the Packers acquired their first 11-0 start in franchise history, beating the 1962 team which started 10-0 and finished 14-1 including postseason play.

It's a condensed version of the original material, presenting the core ideas in a clear and organized manner.\\n\\nHere's a breakdown of what constitutes a good summary:\\n\\n*   **Conciseness:** A summary is significantly shorter than the original text. It avoids wordiness and unnecessary elaboration, focusing on the most critical information.\\n\\n*   **Objectivity:** The summary should be based on the original text and avoid including the summarizer's personal opinions or interpretations. It presents the author's ideas objectively.\\n\\n*   **Accuracy:** The summary must accurately reflect the original text's main points and avoid misrepresenting the author's intentions or arguments. It should faithfully capture the essence of the source material.\\n\\n*   **Clarity:** A good summary is easy to understand and presents the information in a logical and coherent manner. It uses clear and concise language to convey the main ideas.\\n\\n*   **Completeness:** While a summary is condensed, it should still cover all the essential points of the original text. It shouldn't leave out any critical information that would alter the overall meaning.\\n\\n*   **Neutral Tone:** A summary typically adopts a neutral tone, avoiding any emotional language or personal biases. The focus is on conveying the information in an unbiased way.\\n\\n*   **Identification of Key Information:** A summary identifies the main points, arguments, or themes of the original text. This often involves recognizing the central claim or thesis and the supporting evidence or ideas.\\n\\n*   **Avoidance of Personal Opinions:** The summary should only include the ideas and information from the original text. It should exclude any personal opinions, interpretations, or analyses from the summarizer.\\n\\n*   **Use of Own Words:** While a summary may use some phrases or keywords from the original text, it should primarily be written in the summarizer's own words. This demonstrates understanding and helps avoid plagiarism.\\n\\n*   **Structure and Organization:** A summary should be organized logically, typically following the structure of the original text. It may begin with an introductory statement that identifies the topic or author and ends with a concluding sentence that summarizes the main ideas.\\n\\nIn essence, a summary distills the essence of a piece of writing, providing a clear and brief overview of its key points.

    "    \"Typhoon Phanfone has killed at least one person, a US airman on Okinawa who was washed away by high waves. Thousands of households have lost power and Japan's two largest airlines have suspended many flights. The storm also forced the suspension of the search for people missing after last week's volcanic eruption. The storm-tracking website Tropical Storm Risk forecasts that Phanfone will rapidly lose power over the next few hours as it goes further into the Pacific Ocean. Typhoon Phanfone was downgraded from an earlier status of a super typhoon, but the Japan Meteorological Agency had warned it was still a dangerous storm. Japan averages 11 typhoons a year, according to its weather agency. The typhoon made landfall on Monday morning near the central city of Hamamatsu, with winds of up to 180 km/h (112 mph). The airman was one of three US military personnel swept away by high waves whipped up by the typhoon off southern Okinawa island, where the US has a large military base. The remaining two are still missing. A police spokesman said they had been taking photographs of the sea. A university student who was surfing off the seas of Kanagawa Prefecture, south of Tokyo, was also missing, national broadcast NHK reports. It said at least 10 people had been injured and 9,500 houses were without power. The storm was expected to deposit about 100mm of rain on Tokyo over 24 hours, according to the Transport Ministry website. Many schools were closed on Monday and two car companies in Japan halted production at some plants ahead of the storm. More than 174 domestic flights were affected nationwide, NHK state broadcaster said on Sunday. On Sunday, heavy rain delayed the Japanese Formula One Grand Prix in Suzaka. French driver Jules Bianchi lost control in the wet conditions and crashed, sustaining a severe head injury.\",\n",
    "    \"The blaze started at the detached building in Drivers End in Codicote, near Welwyn, during the morning. There was another fire at the building 20 years ago, after which fire-proof foil was placed under the thatch, which is protecting the main building. More than 15 fire engines and support vehicles were called to tackle the blaze. Roads in the area were closed and traffic diverted.\",\n",
    "    'The 18-year-old fell at the New Charter Academy on Broadoak Road in Ashton-under-Lyne at about 09:10 BST, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said.

Principal Jenny Langley said the school would remain \"fully open\" while police investigated. \"Our thoughts are with the family and we\\'re doing everything we can to support them along with staff and pupils,\" she said.',\n",
